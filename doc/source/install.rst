Installing MyGrad
=================
MyGrad requires numpy. It is highly recommended that you utilize numpy built with MKL for access to optimized math
routines (e.g. install numpy via anaconda). You can install MyGrad using pip:

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install mygrad


You can instead install MyGrad from its source code. Clone `this repository <https://github.com/rsokl/MyGrad>`_ and
navigate to the MyGrad directory, then run:

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install .
